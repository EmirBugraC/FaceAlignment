This project to solve the knapsack problem using a genetic algo- rithm (GA), thus analysing the effects of mutation, crossover, and tour- nament selection on fitness. In the system, which included a population of 50 passing over 5000 generations with 50 items, each trial systematically increased one parameter while keeping the other two constant to observe its effect on fitness. While increasing tournament size generally leads to a steady increase in best fitness, higher mutation rates lead to a decrease in fitness. Also, the increased likelihood of crossover led to a decline in fitness. The findings highlight the importance of parameter selection in GA based problem solving.
